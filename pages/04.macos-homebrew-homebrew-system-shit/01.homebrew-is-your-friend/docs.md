Here's what I have brewing in my `brew list` at the moment:

```shell
coda-cli	dart		git		libiconv	libscrypt	openssl		sass		wget
composer	gettext		libevent	libidn2		libunistring	pcre2		tor
```

I should do some sort of write-up on `tor` and how that's used, but I'll save it for another day. Things I use on the common are `git` and `sass` and probably `wget`. I recently [did a massive purge](/macos-homebrew-homebrew-system-shit/upgrading-php-in-the-cli#attempt-4-and-probably-5-if-im-being-honest) of brew formulae, so I am hoping I didn't uninstall anything important.
