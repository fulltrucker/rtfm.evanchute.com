So I put together a better way of easily adding the photos link to the Chocolate Bunny website for each event. This is a HOW-TO guide with pretty pictures and stuff, linked from the CBP MODx Manager to here so it's easy to find. Boom.

## Basic Steps:

1. After logging in to the Manager, click on the Resources tab in the left-hand column.
2. Select the Page you want to add a Photo Gallery Link to.
3. Click on the “Event Information” tab at the top of the edit screen.
4. Make sure the Event Information section is shown.
5. Enter the URL of the photo gallery in the field provided for this purpose.
6. Click Save
7. The link, along with a headline and some text that includes the Event year and name, will display on the event page. Always check to make sure the link is correct!
