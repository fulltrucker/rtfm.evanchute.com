A list of `git` commands that I use all the time, and would like a quick reference to. I should also consider putting these in my XMenu app for quick use _(done)_...

- Switch to an existing branch: `git checkout` _branchname_
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b` _branchname_
- Push a new branch and "create" it on the remote:  `git push -u origin` _branchname_
- Set the remote URL: `git remote set-url origin` _git URL_
