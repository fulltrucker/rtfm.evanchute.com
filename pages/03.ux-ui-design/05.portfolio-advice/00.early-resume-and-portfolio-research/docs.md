Originally captured in a Google doc, these are some of the notes I made for myself when I first made the decision to pivot my career trajectory towards UX/UI Design. I did this research in the first part of the [UX/UI Design Certificate Program](/ux-ui-design/bda-ux-ui-design-course) I took at BDA, and it's mostly resume and portfolio ideas.
