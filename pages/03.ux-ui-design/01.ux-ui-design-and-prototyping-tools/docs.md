This is probably (definitely) not a complete list, but has the highlights of the most popular stuff. I think. Maybe.

## Woah, that's a big list

## Sketch

Soup to nuts, industry standard UX/UI design tool. Does all the shit, but it has some weird nuances.

## Adobe XD

The biggest player in the design game's entry into the XD space, more intuitive than Sketch but scuttlebutt is that it's lacking in some features compared to other tools. https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html

## Figma

Collaborative. New player on the block. Seems to be a lot of buzz around this tool. https://www.figma.com/

## UXPin

I don't no nothing about this tool really, except that they sent me WAY to many emails. https://www.uxpin.com/

## Draw.io

Can be used for user workflows and diagramming. I think this is similar to Gliffy, which I've used for sitemaps, information diagrams, server infrastructure modeling, and shit like that there. https://www.draw.io/

## Balsamiq

Great for quick and dirty lo-fi wireframing, with simple prototyping functionality. Not good (or really even possible to be used) for hi-fidelity UI design. Has a "sketch" display mode that make all elements look hand-drawn, so it's nice for early client presentations where you don't want the client to get hung up on design details. Use Balsamiq (Comic) Sans font for this. https://balsamiq.com/

## Framer

This looks like a friggin' sweet bit of software, the prototyping looks next level. https://www.framer.com/

## Marvel

Supposed to be easy to learn and use, but not as powerful. https://marvelapp.com/

## Adobe Creative Suite

Illustrator and Photoshop, mainly. No prototyping functionality, at least none that I know of. It was all we had 10 years ago, and it was enough. Get off my lawn!
