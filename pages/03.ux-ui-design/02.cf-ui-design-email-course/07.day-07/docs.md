Congratulations – you've almost made it to the end of the course!

We've learned a lot in just a week, and there's still today's lesson to go! Before we jump into our final topic, we'll briefly go over what we've covered so far. 

If you’ve enjoyed this short course and would like to continue learning about UI, take a look at our full **[UI Design Course](https://email.careerfoundry.com/e2t/c/\*W80b0QG6jF371N7DKm98ZxmVT0/\*W88NRcD7t_VY7W3_f3hG8NrmYs0/5/f18dQhb0Sq5K9446tFW7zTdSn8LCvkbW7sT5wq7tC8JhW6Dk5Tq1Qtt6HVLDpF18B-JfnW62SgSr8p0lbXVM6H-f8tzLxGW8rCJVt5x5JmtMScW4_3_jDrVKpbJJ4hvCyfW1Wg49R564hChW4bJ02h4b_rLZW3pcyjG5ySVdwW4qG5C67K2Gx0W5Ycpnx3ZtxJpW4bfcHb47XwnyW2J0wf82HRydFW3cWkhr1nnQd3W1-ZGb11VHbdQW1pqBNS1ks0KjN38yPTgPs031VgkKmy5qr8ZqW4rjM5J3VS6f0W49tBTk1zDJ_QV42cYP3nNLHLW6-64Kk8cXzg9W3kLKKF2XRsp_W8-GJ7t7Pz4xTW86-tbM3bGkNXN73Q0vR1-PQnf3_LkbM02).** You'll learn all the practical skills needed to start a career as a UI designer, even with no prior experience.

So, without further ado, here's a quick recap of the week so far:

**Day 1:** An all-important introduction to the field, exploring what exactly UI design is and what it's like to work as a UI designer. 

**Day 2:** A more detailed look at the foundations needed for all good designers, namely understanding design principles.

**Day 3:** Exploring the basics of UI design: What does it take to make great icons? 

**Day 4:** A closer look at text and typography, including why they are so important in UI design. 

**Day 5:** The role of user psychology in creating usable interfaces, and a brief introduction to UX design. 

**Day 6:** How can designers overcome creative block? Where can you turn for inspiration? 

For our final day together, I’d like to talk a bit about the difference between mobile platforms and how they affect the job of the UI designer.

## **Not Just Smartphones**

What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you read the words “mobile platform”? Smartphones? While smartphones definitely are mobile platforms, they aren't the only device to be considered "mobile." A variety of devices, including tablets and laptops, all fall under the same category.

![Email7-Img1.jpg](https://email.careerfoundry.com/hs-fs/hubfs/CF_Short_Courses/UI_Short_Course/Email7-Img1.jpg?width=1100&upscale=true&name=Email7-Img1.jpg)

Laptops? Yup, laptops. Any device that is portable can be considered a mobile platform. However, because this lesson focuses on helping you develop the skillset you’ll need to make awesome mobile apps for iPhone and Android, we’ll leave laptops out of the equation for now. 

Smartphones and tablets aren’t all made by the same company. You’ll find that companies like Samsung, Apple, or Blackberry all manufacture these kinds of devices. Naturally, this gives way to differences between certain aspects of devices, even when they are the same kind. In other words, iPhones and Androids aren’t identical. The 3 biggest differences between devices manufactured by different companies that will shape your work are operating systems, screen size, and resolution.

## **Mobile Operating Systems**

Mobile operating systems are the backbones of mobile devices. It’s the software found in these mobile devices that enables them to run. Popular operating systems include Android, iOS, Windows OS, and Blackberry OS. Blackberry? That's right: Somehow, it's managed to stick around!

When designing for **iOS**, you’ll want to brush up on the **[iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://email.careerfoundry.com/e2t/c/\*W80b0QG6jF371N7DKm98ZxmVT0/\*W2f_KjD1lN0DGW1qxpyX5r14Dj0/5/f18dQhb0SfHq8Y9XHdW7zTdSn8LCvkbW7sT5wq7tC8JhW6Dk5TK1Vqz72VLDpF18C-90YW63lffJ5_N7twVQzKFC8y_DL1N8Bv8dzNKX53W8zw4V_8C-gChW5yKvS05sgFjdN8rC9Y7RJzkZW37J6PQ65jv23W8z8P4G7mC8P6W78YZ0G9dvgGYW33TgnL4CB5ysW83_Pyq834DLzW8XWFzH2X2qfbW8sKyGY8hydPMW5TYCh67ZX1K2W5ZpycS57-ZBzW7JtXcz2wJClFW2JfBGg5rC5Q6W81MffF7sLfzkN5DFWr2HMLGsN4Nsft2VzQv-VVn7DD6jP-R3W2NCqXn7qHQ6FN1VbPq6Yfg5ZN3xxDzQJhp9BW9h7nQQ8t45rDW754Y7R8hBcSfVT-54C1KDLwVN7SzcblmRw0WDdXyXb_YQyf1KRHs003)**. In the guidelines, you’ll find details on what is acceptable, what isn’t, and all the information you need to replicate its “look.”

**Android**, on the other hand, offers **[Material Design](https://email.careerfoundry.com/e2t/c/\*W80b0QG6jF371N7DKm98ZxmVT0/\*VMf2kh5BCJmFW38Drb94Mx88X0/5/f18dQhb0Sq5J9445H-W7zTdSn8LCvkbW7sT5wq7tC8JhW6Dk5QM1NvXDvVM7Yn35y5C1fW63lH2c8t2SJ3W8tzLxG5_MY5CW8tBcWZ5_VQjGW1q7sLn3JBn8jW2qgd8G2L4g1pW2L7LDM8Xlj5HW2KW3y22MznrNN5nbq6BHwTPvW5WVQ8S74pB9dW8S1Ynk6P4cgpW3VpBHK9dSlS6W35rgCl94SqmCW4yWzqn6XGrR0W7NrMZs3pcMZ2W7bj20S30kZTXW9dH8_66V4mf7N61F1W8wKJnCV3qXXx3nxM7cW3Shtnk51fy2XW61SRwF1B_YzdW2GD9D74bwC1CW9jQc_k7McSM_VM7Gsf8DgWtJW8qj1hN950r5XN7Py50tcYJKQW7dJ18n14FbYbf97gBTj04)** as a style guide. Just like you read above, if you are designing for Android, be sure to brush up on Material Design and its guidelines.

**Working with either?** Check out **[this great list of resources](https://email.careerfoundry.com/e2t/c/\*W80b0QG6jF371N7DKm98ZxmVT0/\*N6PrM3T9kJrMVnf3826dNv4X0/5/f18dQhb0SmhP8XJ9fqW8r_zXm4mQf6dW3Lr2MK8qm0RKN3hHhbVXL0jYVnQ9Qq8-hTdQW1SdKZc5mZ50NW55FBfk5lt9WrVpPmwS8W2c9WW32SChN1ShFnZN8Sz_dXvyzP7W54SlPr8V35yMW8SFg8P32GPPNW23z8YB24zCBgN65j2mhZvG6bW8v2SkQ1mKdNFW62M43765cHlFW8mp2bw8p-Vr0W65kbjq4v8nX1N29ZjRLTyPw-W1p83504LjbqDW1DG3Yv8j22WZW8Tn65J1TxSXbVVFyVn3hn_KWW65jv5C8r8YgzW1lRb4_61mzVzVnZFf268QwVzW3s8y852-Gls9W7dr9qW72YqDyW3KTzqR3sCvTnW3jLSWw5Kr4YgVpCpGv4QDcJ_W1vsWZS8sp8MWW2k8bSC2B6k_1W70RgGG3S8JFJW51G-h53rZ4LZW3y19vM3wMXFCT7TWL2jxvzH103)** that comes packed with UI Kits designed to help expedite your work. You’ll find kits tailored to fit both iOS and Android guidelines alike.

As you look at different apps, both on iOS and Android, you’ll notice not all of them stick to everything in the guidelines. Not every Android app applies Material Design guidelines throughout its user interface.

## **Screen Sizes & Resolution**

Check out **[this list](https://email.careerfoundry.com/e2t/c/\*W80b0QG6jF371N7DKm98ZxmVT0/\*W98DL782s4KX-W4F9C-F1D41dj0/5/f18dQhb0Sjvd93BnpPW8r_zXm4mQf6dW3Lr2MK8qm0RKN3hHhc7XD6prW7cmS1s8pCQ6vW6P98wB3Ktb93W4tWL_090G7thN8S3yR5bY02SW4s86vb1KDMz2W8ShPKD62_s8DW2yhVNK7ZX1K2W5ZpycS57-ZBzW7JtXcz79T9-0W2c2Jvf83KHrFW7J3nH-83C5JPW38bhGq9dH8_6W6V4mf77nHPvYMrPpMvrJh2DW7RZqW51mQYMtN3KlpzkYCpc3N4vgKM142cYPW3nNLHL6-64KkW8cXzg93kLKKFW2XRsp_8-GJ7tW7Pz4xT86-tbMW3bGkNX73Q0vRV1-CMb6-n2NY102)**. Pretty extensive, right? There are almost as many different screen sizes out there as there are devices. Android alone powers hundreds of devices all with different size screens.

## **Mobile: The World of Updates**

Anything mobile is subject to constant updates. Apps get updates, operating systems get updated, and even the very phones that hold both get overhauled. What does this mean? As phones get updated and you see yet another screen size to account for, take a look at your work. Will it scale up or down properly? Do you need to make revisions and release updates for your app?

**Aaaaaand DONE!** We hope that you have enjoyed learning with us. Let us know how you liked the course and whether there is anything we can do to improve it.
