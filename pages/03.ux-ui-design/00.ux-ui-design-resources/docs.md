This will eventually need to be broken down by category, or something. But for now it can be a big-ass list.

## UX/UI Design Tools

### Sketch

Soup to nuts, industry standard UX/UI design tool.

### Adobe XD

### Figma

Collaborative. New player on the block.

### UXPin

### Balsamiq

Great for quick and dirty lo-fi wireframing, with simple prototyping functionality. Not good for hi-fidelity UI design. Has a "sketch" mode that make all elements look hand-drawn, so it's nice for early client presentations where you don't want the client to get hung up on design details. Use Balsamiq (Comic) Sans font for this.

### Adobe Creative Suite

Illustrator and Photoshop, mainly. No prototyping functionality, at least none that I know of. It was all we had 10 years ago, and it was enough. Get off my lawn!
