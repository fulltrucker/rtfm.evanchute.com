## Books

I try to keep an [Amazon idea list of UX design books](https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AEVY2UE7NTGUT4S4JFVSZGLQG3NA/2P5RT31GA6NDN), which might be more up to date than this list. This list might also be more up to date than the Amazon one... who even knows. This list was originally inspired (and populated) after [reading this article](https://uxplanet.org/50-best-resources-for-ui-ux-professionals-c29daf36cd85), but has been augmented with recommendations from friends, UX and dev professionals, people who have interviewed me, and others. As of March 29, 2020 this list has not been curated, organized, or ordered in any way.
