Stuff I've been told to read, have read, and whatever. Got to a point where all of this needed to be mo'bettah organized, so now there are sub-categories by type.

## Books

Yep, books. By an author. About a topic. [Read the list of books you should read here.](/ux-ui-design/recommended-reading/books)

## Websites/Blogs/Online Magazines

This list focuses on entire websites (or blogs, or whatever) dedicated to UX/UI and Product Design. Different than articles in that links here are to the website, not a specific piece of content. [Check it out.](/ux-ui-design/recommended-reading/websites-blogs-online-magazines)

## Articles/Online Reading

Specific articles I find or found compelling. [Don't take my word for it, read those here.](/ux-ui-design/recommended-reading/articles)

## Online Education and Learning
