  * Adaptive vs. Responsive

## Jira and project management overview

There was a lot of discussion about how to use Jira to plan sprints and scope of work, etc. I didn't take notes here, since I've been living in Jira for the last three years. Concepts covered:

* Scrum
* Sprint planning
* Backlog - what is it and how is it used?
* User stories and tasks
* Pointing and/or T-shirt Sizing user stories a.k.a. "Poker Planning"
  * The amount of effort it takes to complete a project
  * It's a way of defining a scope of work by assigning a point value or a size to each story or task
  * ReMax team uses the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) to assign point values to stories to really show how a scope can spiral out of control ***real*** fast
* Jira ticket types
  * Epic
    * They're buckets!
    * Longer or bigger initiatives that can be broken down into smaller stories or tasks
  * Story
  * Task
    * Users haven't identified these needs, these are things that are just "get it done" sorts of things
    * Business requests
    * Examples: Tech debt, New tech, Cleanup, content updates, update a library or computer
  * Bug
    * Breakage in code
    * Unexpected result from a UI element

## How to host and attend a Creative QA

* This might also be called a "Design Review" in many companies or agencies
* Always based around Data and Users, not Opinion.
* 5-7 people with a target of 6 or fewer
  * When there are a lot of people, the chances that one person will take over the convo is greater
  * Dominance control or something like that
  * Keep these 6 people representative of the project: e.g. stakeholders, dev team, designers, key members of the team but maybe not the management and upper level people they just fuck up the process
* Bring design support, tech support, UCD, data... NOT your opinion
  * Make it about the user, data, and the design, not the ***designer***
  * This is the time for critical feedback, not bullying, we're here to add value and make the design better
* Walk through the steps below outlined below
* Wrap-up (the?) meeting: Document results! Assign responsibilities! Confirm actions!
  * Super critical step to ensure no single person is swamped with work, and that everything gets done

### The Creative QA steps/process

* **Spatial design:** make sure the amount of space each required element is taking up is appropriate for that element's importance
* **UI Improvements:** use the right UI element for the thing you're trying to do e.g. dropdown vs. radio, etc.
* **Redundancy:** Is there a lot of the same way to do the same thing or accomplish success? And is that okay? Some redundancy is maybe fine e.g. a close button top and bottom
* **Design patterns:** Make sure things line up, and elements are in the expected place for that element
* [Muri, Mura, Muda](/ux-ui-design/bda-ux-ui-design-course/course-notes-session-3#muri-muda-mura)
* Are the user needs met?
* Are the business needs met?

## A/B Testing

* Control and variation
* Using DATA you can do live production A/B testing by region, demographic, or whatever.
* Can also be done 1-on-1 in a more "user testing" scenario (which we'll do today)

## Dark Patterns

* A dark pattern is a misleading or otherwise deceptive UI/UX decision that tries to exploit human psychology to get users to do things they don't really want to do.

## Prototyping

* Craft is badass
* Use the simple prototyping function which is just linking to another screen/artboard
* Neat transitions are neat

## Homework for next week

* Prototypes
* Type out what would go in a good portfolio in a text document
  * Or do a user flow...
  * ...and a wireframe...
  * ...and a hifi prototype...
